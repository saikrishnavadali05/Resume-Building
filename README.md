Tips on how to start the professional journey with a good resume.

7 Do's & Don'ts of a Resume.
Every aspect of your resume communicates a message to the interviewer. From the layout to colours to your responsibilities & achievements, every part is crucial.
 
1) Naming of files:
- While sharing your resume, name the file properly. 
- It eliminates the chances of your resume getting lost in the pile.
- Use the format [Name] - [Last Name] - Resume.
 
2) Format:
- Make your resume reader-friendly. 
- Add white space.
- Use bullet points. 
 
3) Email Address:
- Never share an unprofessional email address. 
- If you don’t have a proper email address, create a new one for your professional journey.
 
4) Colours, Bolds & Italics:
- Don't use too many colours. It makes the resume difficult to read. 
- Stick to 1-2 colours.
- Bold the sub-headlines & italicize to highlight a specific achievement, if any.
 
5) Cliches and Jargons:
- Avoid the overused and cliche words. Instead, use action words and results to demonstrate your skills.
 
6) Spelling & Grammatical Errors:
- No matter how careful you’ve been, there are chances of minor errors. Such errors indicate that you lack attention to detail.
- Proofread your resume at least three times. 
 
7) Numbers:
- Quantify your results whenever possible. It creates a more powerful impact on the recruiter.

8) Some additions:
1. Use a professional profile picture on your email.
2. No need to write extra description. One line explanation are enough.
3. A monochromatic color schemes is always a thumbs up.
4. Subtly highlight any extraordinary achievement like AIR, National level awards etc.
 
9) Here are the rules of thumb:

1-Page Resume:
- Pre-Final/Final Year students applying for internships/jobs.
- Graduates applying for Off-Campus opportunities.
- Must for "Management Consulting" enthusiasts.
- Professionals between 1 to 10 years of work experience.

2-Page Resume:
- For professionals with relevant experience of 10 years & above.
- For senior-level managers or executives.

3-Page Resume:
- Must Include 1st page as Cover Letter.

Nonetheless, Most resumes can be condensed into one page.
The key is to keep it as short and crisp as possible without losing the essential details. Use CAR or STAR Approach.
Sometimes the formatting isn't right, and other times there are more irrelevant details.
I know the 2-month NGO community work, consulting internships, and various live projects helped you build interpersonal skills but does it need 5-6 points?
If it's exceeding 1 page, then make it worth page-turning to condense up to a single page.

Constantly ask yourself, does this add value?
